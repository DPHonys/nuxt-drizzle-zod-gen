# Nuxt Drizzle Zod Gen

TODO:

- [x] Setup Playground with drizzle in shared folder (just to test - it's not ideal solution.. thats why we need to make the gen module :-] )
- [x] Get Drizzle schema - preferably from Drizzle config if possible otherwise module option
- [x] Watch for changes
- [ ] Generate Zod schemas - use drizzle-zod + zod-to-code - single file
- [ ] Handle split schemas
- [ ] Make zod validation work - somehow (drizzle-zod can take in validation schemas - Refinements)
- [ ] Write to file in .schemas?
- [ ] Add alias for imports - #schemas for importing the zod schemas
- [ ] Test in playground - move drizzle stuff to server folder and import the generated schemas in client
- [ ] Write tests - make sure it works as expected, check if drizzle is in client bundle or not
- [ ] Write docs
- [ ] Publish package
- [ ] Release
- [ ] Announce
- [ ] Celebrate
- [ ] Maintain
- [ ] Get feedback
- [ ] Improve
- [ ] Profit
- [ ] Add more zod 4 support
- [ ] ??? (Have fun!)
